# OTECH Frontend

This is the frontend of the **OTECH** project, built using **React** and **Vite**.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended: LTS version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ruhollah82/OTECH-front.git
   ```
2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd OTECH-front
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

After running the command, Vite will start a local development server. By default, it will be available at:

```
http://localhost:5173/
```

## Build for Production

To build the project for production, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will generate the optimized output in the `dist/` folder.
